## orthobora

A modified version of [vim-parabola](https://github.com/chielkunkels/vim-parabola),
a dark yet colourful, really nice colorscheme for vim. Built for 256-colour terminal.
If you like colorschemes such as [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim) or [hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid),
you might like this (and the original) .
